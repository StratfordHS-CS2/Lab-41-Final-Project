# Lab 41 - Final Project

**This project is your Final.**  This is worth 20% of your second semester grade.  The due dates are strict.  Commit and push what you have by the due date and time even if you are not done.  I will grade what is on GitHub by the due date and time.

If you are exempting the final you do not need to do this project.

### Due Dates:
This project is due by the time your final exam period starts.

* Seniors: Due by May 20th @ 1:34 pm.
* Non-Seniors: Due by May 24th @ 12:59 pm.

### Description:
For your Final you will be making a game where the player moves around trying to catch a target that pops up randomly for a short period of time.

### Requirements:

* The player must move using arrow keys (or WASD, if you think that is superior).  Allow movement in all directions, but the player cannot leave the screen.
* Have a target object appear on screen in a random location for a short, but reasonable, period of time.
* Player tries to collect the target by colliding with it before it disappears.
* The score is displayed on-screen, increasing by one each time the player collects the target.
* Player and target should each be an instance of their class and must be sprites.
* Either the player or the target should be animated using at least 2 images.  Feel free to animate both, but only one is required.
* Frames per Second must be controlled.
